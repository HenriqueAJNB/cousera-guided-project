# Logic explanation

- The computer chooses a secret word.
- The player tries to guess the secret word by guessing one letter at a time.
- If the player guesses a letter correctly, the letter is revealed on the game board.
- If the player guesses a letter incorrectly, a part of the hangman is drawn.
- The game ends when the player guesses all the letters correctly or when the hangman is complete.
